What is sorry
======

Sorry aims to be a configurable static HTML generator. The last one I
wrote failed to pass tests. Instead of trying to sort it all out, I 
decided to write a new one. For more details of why a new one, read the
section "Why sorry" below.

Usage
====

    sorry create mywebsite

creates a new website directory structure with some sample content.

    cd mywebsite
    sorry

creates a deployable directory mywebsite/out
