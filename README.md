What is sorry
======

Sorry is a journal maintainer. It aims at providing a clean interface
to sharing stuff. It tries to minimize the steps you have to go through
simply to share a cool solution to a problem you were having. Or to 
enable you to focus more on the writing than on the templating, committing,
pushing etc.


Usage
====

Sorry assumes a lot. 

* It assumes that one user maintains only one journal. He/She may tag
  the post under various categories but it belongs to one journal only.
  (this is done to ensure minimum time in cd'ing to a directory and stuff)
