A post is uniquely identified by a post id. Simply a number.
A post has the following metadata:
 > A title. Not necessarily unique. But hey!
 > A publishing date. 
 > A comma-separated list of tags.

This is a pre-coding design. Will change radically.
Proposed objects.
 > Link : encapsulates a link. mainly used in templates
          properties : href (String); title (String)

 > Block : encapsulates a block of text that will have one filter
           applied to it. Eg. a block of code. a block of markdown text

 > Post  : encapsulates an ordered list of blocks and metadata that
           constitutes a post. will have the uid prescribed by the system.
 
 > Index : encapsulates an ordered list of posts.


The base design template will have access to the following variables.

 > sitename : String -> Name of the website
 > headlinks : List<Link> -> List of links to present at the top.
 > tagline  : String -> A tagline to describe or sarcastically incise
                        the blog.
 > footlinks : List<Link> -> Context sensitive list of links named newer and older.
 
 > posts : List<Post> 
 > title : Link
