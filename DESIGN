A post is uniquely identified by a post id. Simply a number.
A post has the following metadata:
 > A title. Not necessarily unique. But hey!
 > A publishing date. 
 > A comma-separated list of tags. / not anymore honey. PAH!

This is a pre-coding design. Will change radically.
Proposed objects.
 > Link : encapsulates a link. mainly used in templates
          properties : href (String); title (String)

 > Block : encapsulates a block of text that will have one filter
           applied to it. Eg. a block of code. a block of markdown text

 > Post  : encapsulates an ordered list of blocks and metadata that
           constitutes a post. will have the uid prescribed by the system.
           > metadata attached to a post:
            * uid
            * date (already humanized date) only month and year.
            * author (and that is it)

            * draft: true/false. But this is not to be used inside the
              Post class. Whoever is creating Post objects will just not 
              create the Object for this.

The base design template will have access to the following variables.

 > footlinks : previous and next links
 > posts : List<Post> 
 > title : Link
